## Getting Started

First time

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Run a production build

```bash
npm build
npm run start
```

## Linters support

Most eslint support and config should automatically work on npm install with dev dependencies

## Git Workflow

### Feature branches

- Each new feature should reside in its own branch.
- Feature branches use develop as their parent branch.
- When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.
- Features should never interact directly with master.
